# ApolloDAE Tokens

This repo contains Solidity smart contract code to issue Apollo's Exchange tokens. There are two tokens being issue in our token sale coming up. 

### DAE - The main Apollo token
Our first, and main token will be our official Apollo Exchange token. DAE tokens will be transferable and tradable and be used to pay fee's (currently on Apollo only). Buying these tokens in our ICO will allow you to trade on our exchange for at least 50% less than user's who don't have Apollo tokens when Apollo opens to trading. With our ICO setup, DAE tokens will be sold at an average agreed apon price by the token buyers in the ICO. To read more on how this will be accomplished, visit apollodae.io or read our whitepaper & POA

### AVO token - Voting rights only - no value
Our second token will be a non-transferable, and non-tradable token (exceptions can be made and there is an option to unlocked transfers in the future). This token, called the AVO token, will only be issued to ICO buyers of our Apollo main token, DAE. Inital buyers get these tokens in order to vote on how their funds are being spent in our company. All AVO holders will get to allow or not allow transaction to be created and funds be spent. We also see this as 100% protecting company funds in a massive multi-sig implimentation. Any major ETH movements have to be voted on by AVO holders, and approved by contract Owner Keys (Apollo management). We will also be adding multiple functions that will be locked unless AVO holders approve to unlock them. (ex: a function that will allow AVO holders to tranfer their funds, but will be locked. In the future, this function may be allowed with an AVO vote, and owners approval. This particular function is not allowed at the beginning to keep all AVO voters decentralized and not allow any hackers or malicious actors the chance to buy up or collect all AVO tokens, making AVO multi-sig uselss.)
